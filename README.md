# OCS ProjectLib
OCS ProjectLib is a fully-featured reader and writer of OCS project files.
Every OCS product (Timeline, Waveform and etc.) uses ProjectLib under the hood to open and manipulate various project files and their data.
Currently there is no documentation provided, but only for now though.
